# AceTeam Workflow Engine

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)](LICENSE)

A powerful, modular workflow orchestration system designed for composing complex computational tasks from smaller, configurable steps. This engine powers the workflow functionality in [AceTeam.ai](https://aceteam.ai/workflow-engine) and is now available as an open-source package.

## Overview

The Workflow Engine enables you to:

- Define workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
- Chain node-based tasks with type-safe data passing
- Persist and retrieve node outputs using various storage backends
- Execute workflows programmatically or via API

## Installation

```bash
pip install aceteam-workflow-engine
```

### Claude Code skill (optional)

The `wengine` skill is distributed through the [AceTeam marketplace](https://github.com/aceteam-ai/marketplace) (its source lives here, in [`plugins/wengine/`](plugins/wengine)). If you use Claude Code, install it so Claude can help you explore, compose, validate, and run workflows:

```text
/plugin marketplace add aceteam-ai/marketplace
/plugin install wengine@aceteam
```

## Example

```python
import asyncio

from workflow_engine import IntegerValue, Workflow
import workflow_engine.nodes
from workflow_engine.contexts import LocalContext
from workflow_engine.execution import TopologicalExecutionAlgorithm

context = LocalContext()
algorithm = TopologicalExecutionAlgorithm()

# Load and run a workflow
with open("examples/addition.json") as f:
    workflow = Workflow.model_validate_json(f.read())

result = asyncio.run(algorithm.execute(
    context=context,
    workflow=workflow,
    input={"c": IntegerValue(-256)},
)) # {'sum': 1811}
```

Check the `examples` directory for more sample workflows in JSON form:

- [`addition.json`](./examples/addition.json): basic arithmetic operations
- [`append.json`](./examples/append.json): text file manipulation
- [`error.json`](./examples/error.json): graceful error handling

## Key Features

### Core Functionality

- **Graph-Based Execution**: Workflows are executed as DAGs with automatic dependency resolution
- **Type-Safe Data Flow**: Data passing between nodes is validated using MIME types
- **Flexible Storage**: Supports multiple storage backends (Supabase, Local, In-Memory)
- **Error Handling**: Robust error propagation and logging system
- **Versioning**: Built-in support for workflow versioning

### Workflow Structure

Workflows are defined as JSON with:

- **input_node**: Defines the workflow's input schema using `InputNode`
- **inner_nodes**: The processing nodes that perform computations
- **output_node**: Defines the workflow's output schema using `OutputNode`
- **edges**: Connect node outputs to inputs (including to/from input/output nodes)

### Node Types

- **InputNode**: Special node defining workflow input fields and their types
- **OutputNode**: Special node defining workflow output fields and their types
- **Processing Nodes**: Execute computational tasks with configurable parameters

### Storage Backends

- **Supabase**: Primary storage backend for production use
- **Local**: File-system based storage for development
- **In-Memory**: Lightweight storage for testing

### Value Type Casting

The workflow engine supports automatic type casting between Value types. The graph below shows all available casting paths:

![Value Typecasting Graph](docs/typecast_graph.svg)

Value types serialize to JSON Schema for validation and type resolution. See [Values](docs/values.md#value-schemas-and-type-resolution) for how the schema system works and limitations around deeply nested generics.
