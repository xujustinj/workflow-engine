# Architecture

## Scope

`workflow-engine` sits at the lowest level of abstraction in a toolchain with 4 levels of stakeholders.
The developers of `workflow-engine` itself are the **engineers**.
Developers who use `workflow-engine` to define their own types of nodes are called **operators**.
An operator may provide an interface to let **builders** build workflows with their node types, and to let builders run their workflows.
A builder may publish their workflow to let **users** run it.

Because of these different levels, the engine has the difficult task of catering to conflicting interests, such as with error handling.
We follow the principle that _error messages should be visible to only those who have the power to do something about them_.

## Design Decisions

### Immutability

All core objects (`Node`, `Workflow`, `Edge`, `Data`, `Value`) are frozen Pydantic models. This ensures:

- Thread safety during parallel execution
- Predictable behavior (no hidden mutation)
- Clean serialization/deserialization

To "modify" an object, use `model_copy(update={...})`.

### Async-First

All execution-related operations are async:

- `Node.run()` - Node computation
- `Value.cast_to()` - Type conversion between values
- `Context` lifecycle hooks
- `ExecutionAlgorithm.execute()`

This enables non-blocking I/O operations (API calls, file operations) within nodes without blocking the event loop.

### Type-Safe Data Flow

Edges connect specific output fields of one node to input fields of another. At workflow construction time, the engine validates:

- Referenced nodes and fields exist
- The graph is acyclic (DAG)
- Type compatibility between connected fields (with automatic casting where possible)

### Node Registration

Nodes auto-register via `__init_subclass__` when a concrete `Node` subclass is defined; each registers on `NodeRegistry.DEFAULT` under its derived type name (the class name with the `Node` suffix stripped, e.g. `AddNode` → `"Add"`). This enables polymorphic deserialization: a `Workflow` JSON containing `{"type": "Add", ...}` automatically deserializes to an `AddNode` instance.

### Discriminated Unions

Node serialization uses a discriminator pattern. The base `Node` has a `type: str` field that is auto-populated with the node's derived type name; the registry maps that string to the concrete node class, enabling deserialization without trying every possible node type.

## Workflow Structure

A `Workflow` consists of:

- **input_node**: An `InputNode` that defines the workflow's input schema via `SchemaParams`
- **inner_nodes**: The processing nodes that perform computations
- **output_node**: An `OutputNode` that defines the workflow's output schema via `SchemaParams`
- **edges**: Connections between any nodes (including input/output nodes)

All edges use a unified format with `source_id`, `source_key`, `target_id`, `target_key`. There are no separate "input_edges" or "output_edges" - edges from the input_node and to the output_node use the same structure as edges between inner nodes.

## Execution Flow

1. **Load**: Parse workflow JSON into a `Workflow` object (validates structure, detects cycles, checks types)
2. **Prepare**: Create a `Context` and `ExecutionAlgorithm`
3. **Execute**: The algorithm processes nodes according to its strategy:
   - Starts with the input_node (passes through workflow input)
   - Resolves edges (collects outputs from upstream nodes)
   - Casts values to match expected input types
   - Calls `node.run(context, input)`
   - Stores outputs for downstream nodes
   - Handles node expansion (composite nodes like `ForEach` replace themselves with sub-workflows)
4. **Collect**: Resolves edges to the output_node to build the final result
5. **Return**: Returns `(WorkflowErrors, DataMapping)` tuple

## Error Propagation

Errors during execution are collected per-node in a `WorkflowErrors` object. The behavior depends on the execution algorithm:

- **Topological**: Stops on first error
- **Parallel (FAIL_FAST)**: Cancels remaining tasks on first error
- **Parallel (CONTINUE)**: Runs all possible nodes, collects all errors

Nodes downstream of a failed node are skipped. The engine returns both the errors and any partial output that was successfully computed.
